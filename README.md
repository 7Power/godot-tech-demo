# Godot Tech Demo
Project made with Godot 3 that will hopefully demonstrate what Godot is capable of and also allow for easier creation of various 3D games

Or maybe it should be called "Godot Game Framework"?

Either way, this will hopefully grow to the point where it becomes useful for Godot community and FOSS community in general.
